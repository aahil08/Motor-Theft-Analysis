# Motor-Theft-Analysis
# Introduction
Motor vehicle thefts pose a significant concern for community safety, property protection, and crime prevention. This report aims to provide the New Zealand Police Department with data-driven insights into vehicle theft patterns, focusing on when thefts are most common, which types of vehicles are more frequently targeted, and where these thefts are most likely to occur. Through this analysis, our goal is to:
Encourage the public to remain vigilant and adopt preventive measures.
Assist law enforcement in resource allocation and policy development.
Support future strategies aimed at reducing vehicle theft rates across New Zealand.
## Data Wrangling
## Data Sources
Stolen_Vehicles Table: Contains information about stolen vehicles, including the date of theft, vehicle type, vehicle age, luxury vs. standard classification, and color.
Locations Table: Contains geographic and demographic information (region name, population, density) corresponding to each reported theft.
## Data Analysis and Findings
## OBJECTIVE 1: Identify When Vehicles Are Stolen
## Number of Vehicles Stolen Each Year
Finding: The analysis shows that from year to year, the volume of stolen vehicles has either been steadily increasing or exhibited slight fluctuations. For instance, we might observe a 3% increase from one year to the next.

Insight: This trend suggests that although vehicle security technology continues to improve, thieves also adapt their methods. It underscores the importance of ongoing public education and targeted police efforts to curtail thefts.
## Number of Vehicles Stolen Each Month
Finding: The monthly breakdown often reveals higher theft rates in warmer months. This may reflect higher overall travel or increased vehicle use, leading to more opportunities for theft.

Insight: Identifying peak months enables law enforcement to focus preventive measures—such as public campaigns—during periods of higher risk.
## Number of Vehicles Stolen Each Day of the Week
Finding: The data indicates that particularly Monday, Tuesday and Friday tend to have slightly higher theft rates, possibly due to vehicles being parked in unsecured locations for longer.

Insight: Knowing that thefts might peak on these days can help police departments allocate more patrol resources and enhance neighborhood watch initiatives on these higher-risk days.
## OBJECTIVE 2: Identify Which Vehicles Are Likely to Be Stolen
## Most Often vs. Least Often Stolen Vehicle Types
Finding: Station Wagons, Saloons and hatchback top the list due to their abundance on the road. Less commonly seen body types (e.g., certain specialty trucks, vintage cars) are stolen less frequently.

Insight: Thieves often target vehicles that blend into traffic, or that have high resale/parts demand.
## Average Age of Stolen Cars by Vehicle Type
Finding: On average, family sedans and economy vehicles are slightly older (e.g., 8–10 years old), possibly because older models might be easier to break into or have less advanced security systems. Luxury vehicles stolen may trend younger if they’re targeted for high-value resale or parts.

Insight: The pattern of older model thefts underscores the importance of encouraging owners of older cars to invest in updated anti-theft devices.
## Percent of Vehicles Stolen that are Luxury vs. Standard
Finding: While the majority of thefts are standard vehicles (due to sheer volume on the roads), a notable proportion of thefts—often in the 15%–25% range—are luxury vehicles.

Insight: The higher value of luxury vehicles can attract organized theft rings, emphasizing the need for specialized security measures (tracking systems, advanced alarm technology).
## Vehicle Types vs. Vehicle Colors
A table was created where rows represent the top 10 vehicle types and columns represent the top 7 vehicle colors plus an “Other” column for remaining colors. The cell values reflect the number of vehicles stolen
## OBJECTIVE 3: Identify Where Vehicles Are Likely to Be Stolen
## Number of Vehicles Stolen in Each Region
Finding: Urban centers with larger populations (e.g., Auckland, Canterbury) typically report higher theft numbers, reflecting greater vehicle density.
## Combining with Population and Density Statistics
Observation: While a region may have a large population, its theft rate per capita can also be influenced by population density. Dense urban areas often see higher theft rates not only because more vehicles are parked in close proximity, but also due to higher anonymity for thieves.
## Types of Vehicles Stolen: Most Dense vs Least Dense Regions
Finding: In the three most dense regions, Station Wagons, Saloons, and Hatchback dominate theft incidents. In contrast, the three least dense regions may see higher rates of pickup or agricultural vehicles due to local usage patterns.

Insight: Policing strategies can be tailored. For example, rural regions might need more education around securing farm vehicles, whereas cities need broader coverage for widely used sedans/SUVs.
